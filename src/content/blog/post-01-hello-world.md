## System Initialized

Welcome to my new digital cortex. This blog serves as a logbook for my thoughts, projects, and explorations at the intersection of systems programming, AI, and mobile architecture.

### The Philosophy

The entire site, including this blog, is built on a **Jamstack** architecture using **Astro**. The content lives in a GitHub repository and is deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.

This means I can write a new post like this one in Markdown on any device, push it to the repository, and the site updates itself. It's efficient, secure, and perfectly aligns with a developer-centric workflow.

> This is a blockquote, useful for highlighting key ideas.

You can also use code blocks:

```rust
// Example Rust code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from the new blog!");
}
```

Stay tuned for more technical deep-dives and project updates.
